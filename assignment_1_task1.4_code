# ASSIGNMENT 1 : Task 1.4: 

Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.

## NOTE: Please refer README.md file to get instruction to run the program

#Formula: V=4/3 * π * r 3

### Code: 

	import math

	sphereDiameter = 12
	volume = (4/3)*math.pi*(sphereDiameter/2)**3

	print("Volume of sphere is: ",volume)
